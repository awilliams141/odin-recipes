    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Here’s how you make a pan-fried pork chop that can truly rival a great steak at home: 
        Brine it with brown sugar, pan-fry it, and then baste it with butter. If that sounds a 
        lot like how you cook a steak at home, you’re right — this is basically pork chop steak!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a number of reasons you might want to serve pork chops instead of steak 
        (cost and effort chief among them), but our favorite is this: A steak-fried pork chop 
        is incredibly tender and juicy, bathed with brown, garlicky butter, and just as 
        satisfying as its beefy brethren. Here’s how to cook a pork chop like a steak on the 
        stovetop.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bone-in pork chops, preferably rib chops (1 1/2 inches thick, 8 to 10 ounces each)</li>
        <li>3 cups room-temperature water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the pork chops on a large plate or baking sheet. (Optional — place a wire 
            rack on a baking sheet.) Prick the chops all over with a fork, about 1/8 inch deep. 
            Flip the pork chops and repeat pricking the other side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the water, salt, and brown sugar in a gallon zip-top bag and stir to dissolve 
            the salt and sugar. Add the pork chops and seal the bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bag on a rimmed baking sheet and arrange so that the pork chops are 
            sitting in a single layer. Refrigerate for 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the pork chops from the brine and pat dry with paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot and just beginning 
            to smoke. Add the pork chops and cook for 1 minute on each side — they should begin 
            to brown and release some fat into the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium. Continue to cook for 8 to 10 minutes more, flipping the 
            chops every minute, until they register 135°F in the thickest part.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the pan from the heat. Add the butter, thyme, and garlic. Use a large spoon 
            to spoon the melted butter over the pork chops. Flip the pork chops and baste again. 
            Let the pork chops rest in the pan until they reach 140 to 145°F, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice the pork chops across the grain and serve with the butter sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
